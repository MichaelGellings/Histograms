# Histograms
Dynamically change the step width of a histogram for a given set of datapoints.

## TO DO
### Display
- [ ] Container (grey main element): make resize dynamically (when bar width reaches a miminum width).
- [ ] Show scales / axes.
- [ ] Display datapoints (as list/array).
### User Input
- [ ] Data points: enter via input field.
- [ ] Alternative input: read data points from file.
- [ ] Bin width: enter via input field. (for now)
- [ ] Bin width: change via slider. (eventually)
### Refactoring & Admin
- [x] Create Git Repo.
- [x] Start README.md
- [ ] Check variables' names.
- [ ] Put everything in functions.
- [ ] Possibly spread over several files.
